# Automated Test Coverage Plan for GalaChain Desktop Wallet

**Date**: 2025-07-05  
**Status**: Planning Phase  
**Priority**: High  

## Overview

The GalaChain Desktop Wallet currently has no automated test coverage. This plan outlines a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure reliability, security, and correctness of wallet operations, particularly focusing on cryptographic functions and the recently implemented input focus system.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests (High Priority)

#### 1.1 Cryptographic Operations
**Location**: Core wallet functions  
**Risk Level**: Critical (handles private keys, mnemonics)

- **Wallet Generation**
  - Test BIP39 mnemonic generation (12 words)
  - Verify mnemonic entropy and randomness
  - Test seed derivation from mnemonic
  - Validate secp256k1 private key generation
  - Verify Ethereum address derivation from public key

- **Wallet Import/Export**
  - Test mnemonic validation against BIP39 wordlist
  - Test wallet restoration from valid mnemonics
  - Test rejection of invalid mnemonics
  - Verify private key reconstruction matches original
  - Test address consistency after import/export cycle

- **Key Management**
  - Test secure key storage/retrieval from keychain
  - Verify memory clearing of sensitive data
  - Test error handling for corrupted keychain data

#### 1.2 Input Validation
**Location**: UI input processing  
**Risk Level**: Medium (user input validation)

- **Mnemonic Word Validation**
  - Test individual word validation against BIP39 wordlist
  - Test partial word matching/suggestions
  - Test handling of extra whitespace and case variations
  - Test 12-word completeness validation

- **Address Format Validation**
  - Test Ethereum address format (0x + 40 hex chars)
  - Test checksum validation
  - Test rejection of invalid formats
  - Test GalaChain address format requirements

- **Amount Validation**
  - Test numeric input validation
  - Test decimal precision limits
  - Test prevention of negative amounts
  - Test handling of scientific notation
  - Test maximum value limits

### 2. Integration Tests (Medium Priority)

#### 2.1 Focus System Tests
**Location**: UI interaction systems  
**Risk Level**: Low (UX functionality)

- **Focus State Management**
  - Test clicking field sets focus correctly
  - Test focus persists across frames
  - Test visual feedback (border color changes)
  - Test keyboard input routing to focused field
  - Test Tab navigation between fields
  - Test focus clearing on state transitions

- **Multi-Field Scenarios**
  - Test focus switching between seed word fields
  - Test transfer form address/amount field navigation
  - Test burn form focus behavior
  - Test focus isolation between different wallet states

#### 2.2 State Management Tests
**Location**: Bevy resource and state systems  
**Risk Level**: Medium (application state integrity)

- **Wallet State Transitions**
  - Test navigation between wallet operations
  - Test state cleanup when switching operations
  - Test resource persistence across state changes
  - Test focus state reset on navigation

- **Form State Management**
  - Test form data persistence during focus changes
  - Test form clearing on operation completion
  - Test handling of incomplete form submissions

### 3. UI Interaction Tests (Lower Priority)

#### 3.1 Bevy UI Testing
**Location**: Bevy systems and components  
**Risk Level**: Low (UI functionality)

- **Button Interactions**
  - Test button press detection
  - Test button visual feedback
  - Test button state changes
  - Test disabled button behavior

- **Text Input Behavior**
  - Test text display updates
  - Test character input acceptance
  - Test backspace/delete functionality
  - Test input field text overflow handling

### 4. Security-Focused Tests (Critical)

#### 4.1 Memory Security
- Test sensitive data clearing after use
- Test prevention of memory dumps containing keys
- Test secure random number generation
- Test protection against timing attacks

#### 4.2 Error Handling Security
- Test error messages don't leak sensitive information
- Test graceful handling of corrupted keychain data
- Test behavior under low-memory conditions
- Test handling of invalid cryptographic inputs

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Cryptographic Tests
1. Set up Rust testing framework with `cargo test`
2. Create test utilities for deterministic key generation
3. Implement wallet generation and import/export tests
4. Add BIP39 mnemonic validation tests

### Phase 2: Focus System Tests
1. Set up Bevy testing framework with `bevy_app::App` test harness
2. Create mock UI scenarios for testing
3. Implement focus state management tests
4. Add keyboard input routing tests

### Phase 3: Integration and Security Tests
1. Implement end-to-end wallet operation tests
2. Add memory security tests
3. Create error condition simulation tests
4. Add performance benchmarks for crypto operations

## Test Data Strategy

### Test Vectors
- **Known BIP39 mnemonics** with expected keys/addresses
- **Invalid mnemonic variations** for negative testing
- **Edge case addresses** (all zeros, max values, etc.)
- **Malformed input data** for robustness testing

### Mock Data
- **Deterministic random seeds** for reproducible tests
- **Simulated keychain responses** for storage testing
- **Mock UI events** for interaction testing

## Success Criteria

### Coverage Targets
- **90%+ coverage** of cryptographic functions
- **80%+ coverage** of UI input validation
- **70%+ coverage** of focus system logic
- **100% coverage** of critical security functions

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass in CI/CD pipeline
- No test should take longer than 5 seconds
- Tests must be deterministic (no flaky tests)
- Security tests must include negative test cases

## Tools and Dependencies

### Testing Frameworks
- **Standard Rust testing** (`#[cfg(test)]` modules)
- **Bevy testing utilities** (`bevy_app::App` for system testing)
- **Property-based testing** (`proptest` for fuzzing inputs)
- **Benchmark testing** (`criterion` for performance)

### Test Utilities
- **Test key vectors** from BIP39 specification
- **Mock keychain** implementation for testing
- **UI event simulation** helpers
- **Crypto test utilities** for deterministic operations

## Risk Mitigation

### Security Risks
- Ensure test keys never use production entropy
- Verify test mnemonics are clearly marked as test data
- Prevent test artifacts from containing real keys
- Use isolated test environment for keychain operations

### Implementation Risks
- Start with non-UI tests to avoid Bevy complexity
- Use feature flags to enable/disable test-only code
- Ensure tests don't interfere with development workflow
- Plan for test execution in headless CI environments

## Next Steps

1. **Create test module structure** in `src/tests/`
2. **Implement core crypto unit tests** (highest impact)
3. **Set up CI pipeline** to run tests automatically
4. **Add focus system integration tests**
5. **Expand to full coverage** of remaining functionality
