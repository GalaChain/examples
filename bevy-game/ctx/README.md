Keep contextual files, like design proposals, architectural design documents, planning outlines, 
implementation checklists, and worklog progress outputs here. 

## Contextual Designs, Plans, Requirements, and Work logs

All files should be prefixed by a date stamp in the format `YYYYMMDD_`, e.g. July 4 2025 would be `20250704_`. Use the creation data for the data stamp.

All files should be organized as applicable in the following directories:

* /design - store design decisions here
* /plan - write planning outlines here, including research notes that will inform step-by-step requirements and implementation outlines
* /requirements - write business requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria, functional requirements, technical requirements, and implementation outlines here. 
* /worklog - used to track progress, useful findings, lessons learned during implementation
