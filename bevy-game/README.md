## Bevy Game Framework Example Integration with GalaChain

Work in progress!

This project aims to show a very basic application built in the Bevy framework
that includes basic user identity / key generation and management and token operations.

It can be used as a development tool, or as a point of reference for implementing
key management, identity registration, and balance management in a game.
